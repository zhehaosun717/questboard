// Ports the Fetch standard forbids a fetch() from connecting to
// (https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#port-blocking, "a bad port"). Node's built-in fetch (undici) enforces
// this exact list, so a listen(0) ephemeral port that happens to land on one of these makes fetch() throw
// TypeError: fetch failed / cause 'bad port' even though the server itself is up and listening fine.
// This is the WHATWG Fetch "bad port" list, cross-checked by the reviewer against the `badPorts` array
// bundled in the installed Node v22.23.2 / undici 6.28.0 (82 ports, the same set as below) — not derived
// by scanning. Re-derive it if Node's fetch implementation ever changes its port-blocking table.
